Creating a service principal on Active Directory

Create account
+ full name = fqdn
+ account name = fqdn
+ pre-2000 name = hostname

Don't create the SPN manually, ktpass does it as part of creating the keytab!
On the Domain Controller, and run this from a UAC command prompt:
setspn.exe -U -S netlogin/gate-test.ec.auckland.ac.nz uoatest\gate-test

Create the keytab
ktpass /out gate-dev.keytab /princ netlogin/gate-dev.ec.auckland.ac.nz@UOATEST.AUCKLAND.AC.NZ /mapuser uoatest\gate-dev /ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL +rndpass /crypto RC4-HMAC-NT
